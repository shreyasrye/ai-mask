    - If the specifications ask for **specific granularity**, redact only the terms or phrases specified in the provided text.
    - If the specifications ask for **general granularity**, redact the smallest meaningful context (e.g., words, phrases, or sentences) that includes references to the specified terms.
        - If the smallest meaningful context is:
            - a word: Provide the exact quote of the word only.
            - a phrase: Provide the exact quote of the phrase only.
            - a sentence: Provide the exact quote of the sentence only, from beginning to end.
            - a paragraph: Provide the exact quote of the entire paragraph, from beginning to end.
- Identify all variations of the specified terms in the image, including:
    - Common typos and misspellings (e.g., for "bitcoin", include "bitkoin", "bit coin", "bitcoyn").
    - Hyphenated or split forms (e.g., "Doge-coin", "Doge coin").
    - Case variations (e.g., "dogecoin", "DOGECOIN", "Dogecoin").
    - Contextual references (e.g., sentences or paragraphs that reference these variants in casual or descriptive ways).

- Ensure all identified instances, including variants, are included in the redactions. If no instances are found, return an empty list.
