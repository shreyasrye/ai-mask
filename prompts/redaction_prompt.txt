- Follow the Redaction Specifications precisely.
- If the specifications ask for **specific granularity**, redact only the terms or phrases specified the provided text.
- If the specifications ask for **general granularity**, redact the smallest meaningful context (e.g. phrases, sentences or paragraphs) that includes references to the specified terms.
    - If the smallest meaningful context is:
        - a word: Provide the exact quote of the word only
        - a phrase: Provide the exact quote of the phrase only
        - a sentence: Provide the exact quote of the sentence only, from beginning to end.
        - a paragraph: provide the exact quote of the entire paragraph, from beginning to end.

- For specific words of interest or generic context identified based on a certain word, identify all similar variants of said word, including:
    - Common typos and misspellings (e.g., for "bitcoin", include "bitkoin", "bit coin", "bitcoyn").
    - Hyphenated or split forms (e.g., "Doge-coin", "Doge coin").
    - Case variations (e.g., "dogecoin", "DOGECOIN", "Dogecoin").
    - Contextual references (e.g., sentences or paragraphs that reference these variants in casual or descriptive ways).
    
- Ensure all variations of the specified terms are included, such as split words, hyphenated forms, or alternate spellings.
